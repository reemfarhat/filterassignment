<p>Bedford-Stuyvesant residents rush to the Woodhull Farmstand to buy fresh produce before their
    food vouchers expire and the stand closes for winter.</p>

<p>The vouchers are distributed through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children and the Seniors Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program to qualifying individuals. They receive a booklet containing $4 coupons that can be redeemed at participating farmers’ markets or roadside stands. The vouchers are set to expire November 30, which is when many local farmstands, such as the Woodhull Farmstand, are closing for the winter.</p>

<p>The Woodhull Farmstand is run by GrowNYC and was created in partnership with NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull. GrowNYC is a nonprofit organization that provides environmental programs throughout the city. The stand opens every Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. from July 7 to November 24.</p>

<p>In addition to the food vouchers, the stand also accepts food stamps. According to city data, nearly 29 percent of Bedford-Stuyvesant residents receive food stamps.</p>

<p>Feng Chen, 26, has been working as a stand staff member with GrowNYC for two years. She said accepting different forms of payment at the stands is essential.</p>

<p>“It brings more access,” Chen said. “Residents get to use EBT, they get their health bucks and people of different economic groups can all buy from the stand.”</p>

<p>The Woodhull Farmstand sits at the intersection of Flushing Avenue and Broadway, directly underneath the Flushing Avenue subway station. It is also blocks away from the Sumner Houses, an affordable housing unit that is home to over 2,400 Bedford-Stuyvesant residents, according to the city housing authority.</p>

<p>The busy location brings a unique mix of individuals from all over Bedford-Stuyvesant and neighboring neighborhoods such as Bushwick, according to Miguel de Laveaga, a farmstand manager with the nonprofit.</p>

<p>He said they usually have anywhere between 45 to 60 customers each week.</p>

<p>All of the produce is locally sourced from farmers in New York and New Jersey, according to GrowNYC.</p>

<p>Virginia Thomas, 69, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant just a few blocks from the stand, said she appreciates the stand’s convenient location.</p>

<p>“The nearest grocery store is a ways away. You can get fresh crops and vegetables, which is much better than the cans,” she said.</p>

<p>Julissa Herrara is a Bedford-Stuyvesant resident who serves on the Woodhull Community Advisory Board, which links the NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull and the Bedford-Stuyvesant community.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful program,” she said. “It helps people stay healthy and promotes positive eating.”</p>

<p>Herrara said before she started regularly visiting the stand, she would rarely get produce because it would be out of her way.</p>

<p>Since the stand is located right outside the hospital, Herrara said patients are often excited to stop by there after their appointments.</p>

<p>Access to healthy food options is especially important for the Bedford-Stuyvesant community. According to a 2018 community health survey published by ​​city department of health and mental hygiene, the obesity rate in Bedford-Stuyvesant is 29 percent, which is five percent higher than the city wide obesity rate.</p>

<p>Although the farmstand is closing on November 24, Chen says residents can still utilize GrowNYC’s year round initiatives to receive fresh produce, such as the fresh food bag program, until the stands open up again in April. </p>
